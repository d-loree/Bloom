# Bloom🌹
Bloom is a web application designed to help teams in any field provide anonymous feedback to one another. The goal is to encourage self-improvement by addressing blind spots and areas for growth that individuals might not recognize on their own.

## Hack the Hill🗻
Bloom was developed during the *Hack the Hill* hackathon in Ottawa, where the theme focused on self-improvement. Our team decided to take a unique approach by focusing on enhancing soft skills and people skills, which are often overlooked compared to traditional self-improvement areas like fitness and diet. We had a limited time frame to learn new technologies and develop the project to the best of our abilities.
